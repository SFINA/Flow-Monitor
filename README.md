# Flow-Monitor

This repository contains measurement utilities for SFINA. The Benchmark Simulation Agents extend the Simulation Agent of github.com/SFINA/SFINA to include measurement of e.g.:
- Number of activated links
- Average flow and relative utilization w.r.t. the capacity in the links 
- Number of iterations per time step
- Time of computation per time step
- ...
